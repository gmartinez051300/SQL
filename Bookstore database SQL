Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.

-Create a bookstore database

CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, price INTEGER);

INSERT INTO books VALUES (1,"history", 50, 50);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, "economics", 100, 12);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, "math", 30, 40);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (4, "english", 60, 20);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (5, "science", 40, 50);

-display the datbase ordered by price
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE price ORDER BY price desc; 

- how many books are available to sell?
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM books
